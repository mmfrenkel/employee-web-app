# Employee CRUD Web App

This is a simple Spring Boot web application that surfaces a list of employees and allows a user to perform CRUD operations on that list.

This Spring application makes use of Thymeleaf and JPA for HTML template generation and interaction with a MySQL database (setup using files in `sql-scripts/`), respectively.

Original demo for this application found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial).
